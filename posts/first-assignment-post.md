I didn't have a very specific idea for the first version of the storyboard. I borrowed some vlog videos on the Internet and shot some small clips of life. I hope to build a story of my transition from nervous to relaxed after coming to Melbourne, and full of expectations for the future.
I want to interpret the story through life details and landscape imagery.In the first time,I want to make the water/tree being the main character in the video.But I found it is hard to me and if I do,the video might be abstract. So,I choose anothr method to produce the video. The most importent problem is how to connect different parts of my video.I want to find a part as the main subject to contral the belance of my video.And,the music will be use to indicate the emotion change of my video.

I shot a video of tidied up my desk as a tandem video for my self-portrait.I want to put other parts in this part's diferent position.The first third of the self-portrait describes the awkwardness of arriving in Melbourne.After some transition in the middle, the back shows the joy of living in Melbourne and the vision of the future life.
the emotional tone:stiff&cautious to relaxed&hopeful
In the video, tidying the table is happening right now.Other fragments interspersed in it are experiences from this time past.I want to distinguish between the two situations from the size of the video.The normal-sized size is what's happening right now, and the smaller size is what I'm thinking about.

[The draft of my video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=p5ZX8S1yxI0&feature=shared)
In the process of making the draft, I first cut the fragment of cleaning the desk into several sections and put them on the timeline.Then I added other pieces to the timeline according to the storyboard.Edit the location of each segment in the order from when I arrived in Melbourne.I found the scenes of tidying up the desk too long, so I cut out some of them and kept only the ones with the main action.
In the middle of the video, I used water to express the emotional transition from reserved to relaxed and happy.The music hasn't been chosen yet so it hasn't been added yet.I want to play the sound of the video itself while playing the background music, which can make the audio-visual combination better.
At the end of the video, based on the original storyboard, I added a scene of looking at the city center from the apartment building after walking out of the room.I think it expresses the theme better. Under the sunshine, I am full of longing for my future life and integration into Melbourne.
