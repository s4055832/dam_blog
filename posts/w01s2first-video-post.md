The 30 seconds video
[the 30 secends video](https://youtube.com/shorts/T0zw_zHU-r4?si=JfzzINuoYlRNKvri)
I think in this video, the scene is a little messy, not a story or an idea is cut out, just a simple splicing. And Editing is not skilled enough. It needs practice.
At present, the video still lacks some text expression, clearer emotion expression and light and shadow effect, and I will try to improve it.
