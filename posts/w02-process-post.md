I didn't have a very specific idea for the first version of the storyboard. I borrowed some vlog videos on the Internet and shot some small clips of life. I hope to build a story of my transition from nervous to relaxed after coming to Melbourne, and full of expectations for the future.
I want to interpret the story through life details and landscape imagery.In the first time,I want to make the water/tree being the main character in the video.But I found it is hard to me and if I do,the video might be abstract. So,I choose anothr method to produce the video. The most importent problem is how to connect different parts of my video.I want to find a part as the main subject to contral the belance of my video.And,the music will be use to indicate the emotion change of my video.

I shot a video of tidied up my desk as a tandem video for my self-portrait.I want to put other parts in this part's diferent position.The first third of the self-portrait describes the awkwardness of arriving in Melbourne.After some transition in the middle, the back shows the joy of living in Melbourne and the vision of the future life.
the emotional tone:stiff&cautious to relaxed&hopeful
In the video, tidying the table is happening right now.Other fragments interspersed in it are experiences from this time past.I want to distinguish between the two situations from the size of the video.The normal-sized size is what's happening right now, and the smaller size is what I'm thinking about.
