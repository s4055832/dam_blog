[The draft of my video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=p5ZX8S1yxI0&feature=shared)
In the process of making the draft, I first cut the fragment of cleaning the desk into several sections and put them on the timeline.Then I added other pieces to the timeline according to the storyboard.Edit the location of each segment in the order from when I arrived in Melbourne.I found the scenes of tidying up the desk too long, so I cut out some of them and kept only the ones with the main action.
In the middle of the video, I used water to express the emotional transition from reserved to relaxed and happy.The music hasn't been chosen yet so it hasn't been added yet.I want to play the sound of the video itself while playing the background music, which can make the audio-visual combination better.
At the end of the video, based on the original storyboard, I added a scene of looking at the city center from the apartment building after walking out of the room.I think it expresses the theme better. Under the sunshine, I am full of longing for my future life and integration into Melbourne.
