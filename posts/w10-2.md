Assignment 1
My description in my first assignment was still very immature.
I used the storage room to express the past, and interspersed life clips to show the current state of being angry. Finally, I used the camera looking into the distance to express my expectations for future study and life and integration into Melbourne.

Assignment 2
This set of icons is an extension of the climate theme. I added perspective to the icons and used cyan and red as the main color palette.

Assignmennt 3
I took the Su-style garden as the design concept, showing my understanding of garden structure and the fact that gardens have been increasingly integrated into daily life in recent years. I combined giant rocks and lakes in the environment to create a secluded, peaceful and cozy garden scene.
