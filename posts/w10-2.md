Assignment 1
My description in my first assignment was still very immature.
I used the storage room to express the past, and interspersed life clips to show the current state of being angry. Finally, I used the camera looking into the distance to express my expectations for future study and life and integration into Melbourne.

In my first assignment, I didnâ€™t do a good job in the material shooting and the synchronization of sound and picture. The composition and connection of the material I shot could be improved. The color tone was not uniform.

Assignment 2
This set of icons is an extension of the climate theme. I added perspective to the icons and used cyan and red as the main color palette.

In the second assignment, the icon I made had some stroke issues when it was dynamically interactive. The color of the icon was also desaturated due to my ability. This was different from the expected effect of the icon. I think the icon also lacked a semi-transparent radial gradient outer frame. This could make the scattered elements in the icon more concentrated.

Assignmennt 3
I took the Su-style garden as the design concept, showing my understanding of garden structure and the fact that gardens have been increasingly integrated into daily life in recent years. I combined giant rocks and lakes in the environment to create a secluded, peaceful and cozy garden scene.

In the third assignment, the scene I created was not clearly contrasted. The first part should be about walking in the woods. The second part should be about discovering a garden and exploring it. In addition, when I built the garden, the structure was too simple and not enough to highlight the beauty of the garden. The houses in the garden lacked attributes. I should add some objects that represent the attributes. (Desk, zither, clothes, etc.)
