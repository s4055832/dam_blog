I drew inspiration from the typography of popular social media platforms.

I wanted to enhance the intensity of interaction in the website, so I chose to use Spline modeling and add interactive effects.
At the same time I also started working on the layout for the website.

In the current version of the layout I chose desaturated blue and orange as the main colors. This way the canvas colors donâ€™t steal the eye but they also draw the eye more because they are contrasting colors.

I used the timeline function of Photoshop to make a GIF image. It is about the movement of two circles. Adding this image to Figma can make the web page more interesting. In addition, I chose the cyan color of the circle, which is related to the initial page. In this way, the addition of the image can connect all the pages in color and make the web design more unified.
