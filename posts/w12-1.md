I saw other students' works in this class, which gave me a lot of inspiration. I realized that I should enhance the hierarchy of the website. If too much content is crowded on the same desktop, it will weaken the audience's perception of its importance.
Because as the page hierarchy increases, links between pages are also essential.

I built a model in spline and added interactive effects to each panel. When the mouse hovers over the corresponding panel, it will bounce upwards, forming a water ripple effect.
