I built a model in spline and added text interaction based on the previous interaction. This way, the model can be used as a directory in my website, which enhances the overall interest of the website.

The bad news is that I imported the model from Spline into Figma through the Anima plugin. Since I am not a member, my free browsing of Anima has been used up and I cannot see the display effect of the model in Spline. I am a little worried about the final display.
I changed the camera of the catalog model（Spline） on the initial page to a normal side view, and added this new model to each task main page to strengthen the visual connection between the web pages.
